✅ VPN Setup Steps Using Windscribe
VPN Service Selection:

I selected Windscribe VPN (Free Tier) for this task due to its good reputation, free data allowance, and ease of use.

Account Creation:

Visited https://windscribe.com and signed up for a free account using an email address and password.

Client Installation:

Downloaded the Windscribe VPN client for Windows from the official website.

Installed the software and logged in with my registered account.

Connecting to a VPN Server:

Opened the Windscribe application.

Selected the "Best Location" option (or manually chose a free server like the United States or Germany).

Clicked the “On” button to connect.

The connection was established successfully and confirmed with a "Connected" status.

IP Address Verification:

Opened https://whatismyipaddress.com in a browser.

The displayed IP address and location were different from my actual location, proving the VPN was working.

Secure Browsing Test:

Visited multiple websites while connected.

All traffic was encrypted, and browsing worked smoothly.

Disconnect and Compare:

Disconnected the VPN.

Revisited the IP checker to confirm my original IP and location were restored.
